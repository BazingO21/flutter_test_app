# My Flutter Test App

## Getting Started

I created a test application. 
The application display the text "Hey there" in the middle of the screen and after tapping on the screen a background color be changed to a random color. 
I also add other feature to the app: 
-after double tapping on the screen a background color changed on the previous color (if that exists),
-after a long press color be saved in a "Saved colors" list.

Regardless of the test results, I want to thank you for the opportunity to spend the last three days with interest.
